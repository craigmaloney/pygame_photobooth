pygame_photobooth
=================

Rough Pygame Photobooth (but it's getting better)

You'll need to install the following (preferably as system packages):

* Pygame
 * libsdl-mixer
 * libsdl-ttf

The Arduino code sends a "Pressed!" event over the serial port. If you have configured the photo booth to accept input from the serial port you will need to ensure the program has access to the serial port.
* Arduino UNO shows up under /dev/ttyACM0. You'll need to add your user to the "dialout" group
* Arduino Duemilanove shows up under /dev/ttyUSB0.

The configuration file "config.yaml" has the default values in there for the application:
* ``camera_resolution_x/y``: The resolution of the camera hooked up
* ``offscreen_resolution_x/y``: The resolution of the screen
* ``serial_button``: Whether to check for the serial button or not (default: False will run without the button)
* ``serial_port``: The port for the Arduino button (/dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0)
* ``photo_directory``: Where to store the photos (default: ./photos)
* ``fullscreen``: Whether to display fullscreen (default: True)
* ``max_alpha``: Alpha range from 0-255, with 0 being invisible and 255 being completely opaque
* ``alpha_step``: How quickly to remove the overlay. Larger numbers are faster. 0 will not display the overlay.
* ``theme``: Configuration specific to the theme
 * ``directory``: Where the theme is locted
 * ``overlay``: Image to overlay over the screen
 * ``attract_sound``: The sound to play every-so-often
 * ``font``: The font to use to display (TTF Font)
 * ``countdown sound``: The sound to use for the countdown
